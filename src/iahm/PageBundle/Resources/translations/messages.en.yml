        <p>This is a favorable time for a new manifestation and a new revelation of the Presence and Glory of God! We see everywhere in Europe a deep desire to see the Kingdom of God being established in an innovative way! And this has been confirmed by a prophetic word we have received during a large gathering in Switzerland last summer: a healing river overflowing on the city of Lausanne and its surroundings.</p>
           <p>And that is what we are going to live during this healing conference in 2016; experience the presence of this extraordinary God who transforms, sets free, teaches, saves and heals!</p>

    HeidiBaker: >
        <p>Heidi Baker, born 1959 is a Christian missionary and with her husband Rolland are founders of Iris
            Global and the author of several books.</p>

        <p>With her husband Rolland, Heidi founded IRIS Ministries in 1980, a non-profit Christian ministry
            dedicated to Jesus and service, especially among the poor. In 1992, after twelve years ministering
            in Asia, they left to obtain PhD's at King's College London, UK. In 1995 they started a new ministry
            to the poor and homeless children in Mozambique.</p>

        <p>Beginning with nothing, within a matter of months they were given a dilapidated orphanage in Maputo
            with 80 children. From there, the ministry has expanded to include well-drilling, free health
            clinics that service the poor and sick, feeding programs, primary and secondary schools, cottage
            industries and now over 5000 churches in Mozambique and a total of over 10,000 churches in over 20
            nations. There are multiple 'bases' with Bible schools, as well as community outreaches and
            top-ranked public schools. In September 2008 Iris Ministries started a well digging project in
            Northern Mozambique.</p>

        <p>Their ministry is known for its reports of miracles, and in September 2010 the Southern Medical
            Journal published an article presenting evidence of "significant improvements" in auditory and
            visual function among subjects exhibiting impairment before receiving prayer from the ministry.</p>

        <p>Originally from Southern California, the Bakers are now based full-time in Pemba, Mozambique. They
            also travel to various places around the world to share their story, and to teach about God's love
            and what love in action looks like. The core value and message of the Bakers ministry is God's love.
            Rolland Baker is the grandson of missionary H.A. Baker. Candy Gunther Brown, professor of religious
            studies at Indiana University, has called the Bakers "among the most influential leaders in world
            Pentecostalism"</p>
    Jean-LucTrachsel: >
        <p>Since his early age, God called him to bring His Word with a demonstration of power. He has
            travelled over the five continents, has visited more than 50 nations and was able to share the
            Gospel to all kind of circumstances and situations. Visionnary and entrepreneur, he believes
            that NOTHING IS IMPOSSIBLE. He works actively to bring unity among the Christians to proclaim
            the Gospel with mercy and compassion to this generation. His sensibility to the Spirit allows
            the manifestation of the supernatural with signs, miracles, healings and the salvation.</p>
    Jean-MichelTour: >
        <p>Youngest son of three children, and from a catholic education, Father Jean-Michel Tour began
            perceiving the call of the Lord in 1986 which was clear in 1989 in a school of evangelization.
            In 1999 he has decided to join the diocese of Toulon (France) and integrated La Castille
            (France) and was ordained a priest in 2003.</p>

        <p>His call appeared in the Charismatic Revival; he lives his ministry being sensible to the Holy
            Spirit and the presence of Jesus. He likes experimenting His fire and works so that it sets fire
            in the hearts.</p>
    MatthiasKuhn: >
        <p>Leader of G-Movement and the Aussendungshaus (house of mission) Thun in Switzerland.</p>

        <p>Kuno is pastor GPMC and a shoe shop assistant. Moreover he is a co-founder and co-leader of the
            Aussendungshaus (house of mission) in Thun, where young people are taught and prepared to go
            everywhere in Switzerland and abroad in order to found new Christian congregations. He is eager
            that Heaven may open on this earth in every place and any domain of human community and in every
            personal life. Kuno’s fresh, direct and uncompromising manner of living as Jesus and his
            disciples did, causes us to learn more.</p>
    MichaelKoulianos: >
        <p>Evangelist, Author and co-host of Jesus Image's TV program "Living for Jesus", was born in Tarpon
            Springs, Florida. He gave his heart to Jesus Christ at the age of 12. That same year he preached his
            first message.</p>

        <p>At the age of 16, in a school founded by his parents, Theo and Evelyn Koulianos, Michael started a
            meeting with 6 students. Within a few weeks, these services grew to capacity crowds as the Holy
            Spirit began to draw young people from all denominations and backgrounds to Jesus Christ. Hundreds
            of lives were changed during these amazing gatherings.</p>

        <p>Michael married his wife Jessica in 2004. Shortly thereafter, he was ordained into the ministry. He
            has assisted in some of the largest evangelistic meetings in history, with millions in attendance.
            In 2005, he was given the privilege of being the lead Pastor of World Healing Center Church in
            Orange County, California.</p>

        <p>After a series of supernatural events, in October of 2007, Michael’s life was forever changed in a
            church in Westport, CT. It was here that the power of God overwhelmed him like it did when he was a
            twelve year old. Now Michael has one desire to love Jesus and introduce Him to as many people as
            possible. He believes that Jesus is the only answer to all of our needs. His life’s call is to be
            used of God to reveal His Son to the world by the Power of the Holy Spirit.</p>

        <p>This would eventually lead to the founding of Jesus Image, the evangelistic ministry of the Koulianos
            family. Jesus Image is focused on winning cities, nations and the world with the Gospel of Jesus
            Christ. Michael now travels the world ministering the Good News of Jesus Christ to the lost, praying
            for the sick and teaching the Word of God. The Lord is confirming His word with notable signs
            following. Thousands have come to Jesus and multitudes have been healed by the Power of God. Both
            Michael and Jessica frequently appear on worldwide television. He is also the author of the
            life-changing book – The Jesus Book</p>
